# ✨ So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. (We'll set that one up later.) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (🐺)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (⭐️)**.

# Contest scoping

## 🐺 C4: Set up repos

- [ ] Get GitHub handles from sponsor.
- [ ] Add sponsor to this private repo with 'maintain' level access.
- [ ] Send the sponsor contact the url for this repo to follow the instructions below and add contracts here. (Example message below)

> I just sent the invitation to access a private repo we'll use to scope your contest. Once you accept the invite (it should be in your email), the repo will walk you through what we need step-by-step.
